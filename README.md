Milestone 5: Unique Path and Shareable Link
Objective: Generate a unique URL for each resume and provide options for sharing
or downloading the resume.
Action Steps:

● Unique URL Generation: Create a unique URL for each user’s resume, such as
`username.vercel.app/resume`. This feature allows users to easily share their
resumes with potential employers or friends.

● Download as PDF: Implement a feature that allows users to download their
resume as a PDF file. This is an important feature because many users will want
a hard copy of their resume for job applications.

● Social Sharing Options: Add options for users to share their resume links via
social media platforms or email. This increases the visibility of their resume.

● GitHub and Deployment: Finalize all the changes, update your GitHub
repository, and redeploy on Vercel.
